Welcome to the ECCB18 Metagenomics Tutorial!
============================================

Welcome to the ECCB18 Metagenomics Tutorial. This tutorial will guide you through the
typical steps of metagenome assembly and binning.
You will run the workflow using the Common Workflow Language and all tools will be executed inside Docker containers.
This facilitates reproducibility, portability and reusability of the workflow and its individual components.
