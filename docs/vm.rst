Setting up your de.NBI Cloud instance
=====================================

As metagenome assemblies require a lot of compute resources, we will run the tutorial
on the `de.NBI Cloud infrastructure`_. Each workshop participant will log into a dedicated virtual machine (VM) and
run all jobs on this machine.

.. _de.NBI Cloud infrastructure: https://cloud.denbi.de/

The VM can be accessed by pointing your web browser to::

  https://<number>.llil.de

Where :code:`<number>` is the number of the VM that has been assigned to you, e.g. :code:`https://123.llil.de`

You will be presented with a web-based text editor for editing files
as well as a terminal window for command line access.


The files view should contain a directory called :code:`eccb18tutorial`.
The contents of this directory are also available `here`_.
