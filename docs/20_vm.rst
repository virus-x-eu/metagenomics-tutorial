Setting up your de.NBI Cloud instance
=====================================

As metagenome assemblies require a lot of compute resources, we will run the tutorial
on the german de.NBI Cloud infrastructure. Each workshop participant will log into a dedicated virtual machine (VM) and
run all jobs on this machine.

The VM can be accessed by pointing your web browser to:::

  https://<number>.llil.de

Where :code:`<number>` is the number of the VM that has been assigned to you.
